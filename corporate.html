              A colour scheme (with HTML colour codes, which must be consistent with your final website)

                  #FB6107
                  <em>Orange represents warmth, playfulness, and being bold. These represent what we want our consumers to feel after having used our service. Orange also stands for the Dutch national color.</em>
                </li>

                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #fbb02d"></span>

					<em>Green represents balance, harmony, and calm. Most expats come to the Netherlands to work or go to school we want to create a healthy balance between work or school and their social lives so they don’t overwork themselves and also have fun and harmony in their free time.</em>

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Font choices</li>
			  <p>We have chosen two fonts. </p>
			  <p>Our first font is Open Sans. This font is designed with neutral and open forms yet has a friendly appearance. The font is specially designed for web and mobile interaction which is important for us because we are mainly communicating with our consumers through our website and social media. We will use this font for big texts and paragraphs on our website and social media.</p>
			  <p>Our second font is Fira Sans, this font aims to cover the legibility needs in screen quality and rendering. It’s also a bold and attention-grabbing font and because this font is used in our logo and all headers that’s acutely what we need.</p>			  
			<li>User interface patterns (e.g. grids, carousels, menu organizations etc.)</li>
			  <p>We decided to put a carousel together with our logo on the front page to give a quick overview of what there is to find on the website and already bring over the feel of our brand with the chosen pictures shown in the carousel. On our landing page we also put the links to our Instagram and Facebook in the corner for fast excess we did this with every subpage too.</p>
			  <p>For our menu, we choose a slide-down menu so that when you open the website you will first see our carousel, logo, and landing page instead of the menu. Our menu consists of Home, our brand, meet the team, teaser, and corporate. We choose this order because first our home page is the introduction then we show our brand so what we stand for and what our values are after that we show the team behind our brand.</p>
			  <p>The meet the team is set up in three squares every square has a photo and a background story of one of the team members, we did this to get a more personal connection with possible customers.</p>
			  <p>On the teaser subpage, we first have a call to action buttons to our Instagram and Facebook to get more traffic on our socials beneath that we have a carousel with impression photos to help show what we stand for. When you scroll down you will see some of our first with a small text about the post to show our possible customers a preview of what we post and can get them interested.</p>

          <h4 id="production-3" class="mt-2">Testing Report</h4>
          <p>We created a website for our brand. It is called FindYourFolks. Our website goals are that our target audience, the expats, can easily find what are brand is about, who our team is and what our brand actually does for our expats.</p>
		  <p>We have three testing participants who are expats from the age of 20 till 35 years old. The tests are being done offline, which means on location. The following instructions were being given:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Find a piece written about Ymke.</li>
			<li>Find our values.</li>
            <li>Find the link to our Instagram.</li>
		  <p></p>  
		  <p>The users liked the different colours on the website. They did find their way through the website. They love the logo and think that it is nice how we created it. Besides this, the users mentioned that they find it good that we used a lot of big visuals because that gives a direct impression about what our brand is or could be. Suggestion from tester is to put a link to the post instead of the post self to get more traffic on the socials. In addition to this, they mentioned that it would be better to show exactly where to find our social media platforms. Right now, you can find the social media icons below in the right bottom part.</p>  
          </ul>

          <!-- End Production, start Marketing -->

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>Our marketing campaign is called: ‘’Feel the Folklore!’’ 
             Feel the Folklore has been used in the past, where it refers to common traditions coming from one culture, while being celebrated by a specific group of people from one nation (Marketing The Conscious Club, 2020). However, we now live in a world, where globalisation brings many cultures and people together, where new problems occur.</p>
		  <p>As an expat, you may have a hard time connecting with people due to cultural differences, language barriers or   just internal insecurities, you as an individual still need to develop. You need to adjust to the new    	  traditions, habits and cultures that are being introduced. But what do you do when you can’t find your way around?</p>
		  <p>Our marketing campaign is about increasing social-cultural awareness to help expats finding their way to feel more at home in the Netherlands and to develop their own social skills by connecting through cultural differences.</p>
		  <p>The message of our campaign that we are trying to send across is that you as expats are not alone with struggling to feel at home and not alone, when you can’t find your way around in the new country you live in.</p><p>To approach our target audience correctly, we are making use of promotional activities through our social media platforms Facebook and Instagram, where we post (fun) facts of different cultures, (traditional Dutch) activities to do in the Netherlands, self-help tips to develop your social skills and share the events we are organizing to bring all our customers together. We make use of stories, posts, short videos (reels) and short Q&amp;A’s through the stories to communicate with our target audience to understand what content they like and don’t like.</p>
		  <p>We expect to reach our marketing objectives easily by using the social media platforms Facebook and Instagram, due to the fact that these two platforms are the most fast growing and popular applications being used by our target audience to communicate with one another (Biggest Social Media Platforms 2023 | Statista, 2023b).</p>
		  <li>We expect to have a reach of 200 people by the 15th of April 2023. Besides this, we expect a total amount of 50 likes of all the post we have done by the 15th of April 2023.</li>
		  <li>We try to create an affect, where the expats feel heard and not alone by providing them events, that solves their problem of not being able to connect with the Dutch culture and people, which results in not feeling at home.</li>
		  <li>For the response we expect our target audience to gain knowledge about culture differences and similarities, develop social skills.</li>
		  <p></p>
          <p>Eventually all of these objectives will result in expats attending to our future events we are organizing specifically for them to reach our brand values: cultural appreciation, inclusivity, curiosity and personal growth. Since we believe that bringing the locals and the expats together will have positive outcomes. By sharing different cultures with each other, people can learn a lot from each other while creating beautiful bonds. </p>
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>We learned that choosing Instagram and Facebook as the two platforms to communicate with our target audience resulted differently than our expectations while executing our campaign on both platforms. We noticed that the target audience within the Netherlands only engages on our Instagram platform instead of Facebook. The reach of Facebook was zero, which means that even though expats from the age of 20 till 35 years old do make use of the platform, rather choose Instagram to communicate with others. In addition to this, we learned that creating a content media planner must be adjusted, while executing the content forms we thought of.</p>
		  <p>A good example is that we posted mostly just nice photos, yet it resulted in zero reach and not more than two likes on our platform. Our target audience tends to prefer short videos instead static posts. The next time we should do better research and think better through what platforms we are going to choose to work with to reach our target audience. In addition to this, we should make more use of hashtags to create a bigger range of being seen or bound on the platform and to share more short videos on the platform because it results in a better reach. </p>	
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>In the beginning, we only posted two times a week and we didn’t make good use of all the insights that Meta was giving us. In the future, we can say that we must use the insights we receive of what our target audience interacts with earlier than to just keep on ignoring all the information that is being given to us.</p>
          <p>Besides this, there are many competitors on social media who want to have the attention of the follower. So, by posting more in the future, we show up more on their timeline that gives more engagements and automatically impacts the algorithm in a positive way for our account to be pushed forward on the timeline of our target audience. It is smart to focus only on one social media platform instead of two.</p>
          <p>So, in the future, it would be smart to only focus on Instagram rather than Facebook because the target audience doesn’t engage that much on that platform and due to the fact that Facebook has so many other features such as selling markets and communities, it is already harder to reach the timeline of our target audience.  </p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Expats do not feel as connected to Dutch people as to other expats. Though most Dutch people have mastered the English language quite well, expats experience a distance when speaking to them. Dutch people in fact tend to be more distant towards strangers, especially foreigners. They also experience people speaking Dutch regardless of them, non-speaking Dutch expats, being in the room. They feel closer to expats because expats share experiences with them, and Dutch people don’t.</li>
            <li>The first months in the Netherlands felt very lonely for expats, especially during the pandemic, when some expats spend all their time in their own room. An interviewee explained how she got lost at night and had no one to call. All of her friends, family and neighbours she would normally reach out to were in her homeland. Dutch people they come across have their own set group of friends, so they don’t have a necessity to meet new people.</li>
			<li>Most social events and conventions feel to large of scale to actually support the socialising process. For instance university. The interviewees expressed that they felt that university didn’t support them in socialising with the other native students. It was difficult to find comfort, or a little “home” at first. Because their “home” was miles away from where they were.</li> 
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Small-scale cultural festivals with up to 150 to 200 visitors. By keeping it small-scale we allow people to have to opportunity to socialise. Every event will have a separate theme, like music, food or art. The events will have specific areas reserved for chatting (chatterboxes) and getting to know new people, but socialising (in English!) is encouraged everywhere. We want to create a safe space for people that are far away from home and simultaneously encourage them to come out of their shells and strike up a conversation, and find their folks in the Netherlands. In addition to this, it would be nice to have small games, games to play outside as well in a park, to bring people together. The Ticket-Bring-A-Friend-Deal: If a person goes to an event for the first time, where they feel a bit scared. They can bring one friend/familymember/collegue/etc. on their ticket for half of the price.</li>
			<li>We will be offering free online crash-courses about different cultures. People can sign up and learn about the food, music, language and habits to get a better understanding of different cultures. These courses can also be used for people that are going on an exchange from the Netherlands to another country, thus being an expat themselves.</li>
			<li>Scouting events will be arranged at various international universities and companies. We will be making people aware of our event and with that not just get foreigners, but also Dutch people to tag along and get out of their own bubble and feel foreign in their own country.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Expats between the ages of 20 and 35 years old...</li>
            <li>Who are in the Netherlands no longer than three years.</li>
			<li>Expats that came to the Netherlands by themselves and feel a bit lonely. They are looking for some company in their lives.</li>
            <li>Want to improve their social skills</li>
			<li>Expats that struggle to make connections not only for having company, but also having a buddy that helps them figure out how the Dutch government works.</li>
			<li>Make use of Facebook and Instagram</li>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Early adopters</strong></p>
			<p>People, foreigners and Dutchies alike, who are eager to learn about new cultures and want to make friends from all over the world. These people are open to all points of view on life and are not judgmental or sensitive to extreme culture shock.</p>  
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unique value proposition</p>
          <ul>
            <li>FindYourFolks crosses borders. Between countries, cultures and people. We stand for unity and acceptance. We focus on that interpersonal connection: that we are all different, and that it’s beautiful to be different. We can offer people the buzzing ambiance of a festival without the great scale and unpersonal social aspect of it. We provide space to enjoy culture – whether it be music or dance – and to meet people and find your folks. They can find their own family from all over the world, in the Netherlands.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unfair advantage</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Scaling up is tempting when sales go up, but we remain small-scale, thus remaining a reputation.</li>
			<li>Because we are small-scale we can focus on sustainability more, by offering biological food or making space to separate waste. The general waste produced will also be less.</li>  
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Channels</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our target audience is most active on Instagram and Facebook, of which the latter is also often used for finding housing and such. On those channels we will make our customers aware of the brand and its services. If they are further interested in FindYourFolks, they can visit our website where they can sign up for newsletters or buy tickets for an upcoming event. </li>
            <li>Our website <a href="https://ymkevanderwerf.github.io/FindYourFolks/">ymkevanderwerf.github.io/FindYourFolks</a> </li>
			<li>In addition to this, we also created Instagram and Facebook stories with the upcoming events we are going to have, where the followers can click on the link in the post or swipe up to be directly guided to the website where they can buy their tickets</li>  
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Key metrics</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The follower count on our Facebook and Instagram, including the amount of accounts reached. As our main channels, these numbers are important to keep track of our popularity.</li>
            <li>The number of likes and views per post. These numbers provide extra insight in whether our marketing strategy works. If the likes and views go down, we might want to consider changing strategies.</li>
			<li>The amount of clicks on our website link. The people that click on the link are more likely to seriously consider attending an event.</li>
			<li>Ticket sales. If every event sells out, we could arrange events more often or up-scale (with a limit to contain our small-scaled ambiance).</li>  
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Revenue streams</p>
          <ul>
            <li>For larger events (up to 500) people, we will cover expenses with sponsorship deals and/or crowdfunding.</li>
			<li>TTicket sales – since we organise small scale events and our audience partially consists of students, prices of tickets should stay between 5 and 10 euros.</li>
			<li>Food and drink sales – Depending on the type of event (say a food event vs a music event), there will be a variety of food stands. The first drink will be included in the ticket price, and after that drink prices are on average 3 euros per beverage and dishes are between 8 and 15 euros on average. In addition to this, we add snacks, where the amount is 5 euros per snack max.  Part of this revenue will go to the people selling the food/drinks.</li>
			 
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>
          <ul>
			<p>Fixed</p>
            <li>Venue hiring. Since we don’t have our own location, we must hire a place, where we could organize our event.</li>
            <li>Insurance for employees. It is important to always have an insurance for all employees within a company to foresee liability costs</li>
			<li>We choose to have volunteers and are searching for people to fund us or crowdfund our events by combining our strengths together with other brands/ companies.</li> 
			<p></p>  
			<p>Variable</p>
			<li>Salaries for employees (though we partially also rely on volunteers)</li>
			<li>External food/drink stands</li>
			<li>Artists/performers</li>  
			<li>Photography and videography</li>  
  
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Services/products</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We offer events in which people from all over the world can discover other cultures, while reminiscing their own. Events like this haven't been done before, since we focus on intercultural and interpersonal connection.</li>
            <li>We want to be a safe space for foreigners and natives alike, so we offer those little events to give the feeling of home.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p>Throughout out project, our brand developed a little in terms of concept. At first we tried to focus on closing the gap between Dutch people and expats, but we evolved into a brand that strives to be a safe space. With our events, we try to create a big mix of cultures. We will measure if our brand is successful by recording the willingness of people to attend our event. If there is more animo than we can properly serve to, we can always think about organising more events.</p>
		  <p>In terms of competitors, there aren’t many. Of course, networking events are not a new invention. However, because our brand focuses on the (inter-)cultural aspect, we have an original way of connecting people. By keeping it small-scaled, the human contact is central, which is also different than those big festivals with loads of alcohol and loud music. We value the activities of the festival as much as the connection between our visitors.</p>
