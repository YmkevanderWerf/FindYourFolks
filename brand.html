          <p>Feel the Folklore! We are FindYourFolks and we are here to make you feel at home.</p>
          <p>When moving across borders for either work or study, it is important to create a new home for yourself. A place where you can build your own routines and shape your lifestyle. However, when in a country where you don't know anyone and don’t speak the language, you might face some challenges.  </p>
          <p>Dealing with the Dutch can be difficult when you're new here. They are stiff and cautious, while simultaneously direct. Some may even say borderline rude. However, as stiff as we can be, we as Dutch people do want you to feel welcome. You are a part of society now, and we believe you should be able to move along. </p>
          <p>We believe that people from all over the world should be able to participate in their own culture, without feeling the need to hide away because they are abroad. We are here to help you. Meet new Dutch friends, by letting them experience your culture, while you get to experience theirs. Completely emerge yourself in new experiences and feel the appreciation from one culture to another.  </p>
          <p>No matter where you are from, or how far away your “home-home” is, FindYourFolks can and will help you stay close to home, even if you're 2000 kilometres overseas. </p>
		  <h2 class="w-50 border-bottom border-3 border-info">Cultural appreciation </h2>
          <p>A world without any culture, what would that be like? Without culture, there is no art, no tradition, no cuisine... Our culture is how we define ourselves, how we interact with others, and what we believe in. Culture is so engraved into our lives, and we believe that culture should be appreciated. Don't just follow certain rules but open the conversation. Why do people act and go about their lives the way they do? If we can understand that from ourselves and others, we can learn and make the Netherlands (and the world) a better and more colourful place, for everyone. </p>

          <h2 class="w-50 border-bottom border-3 border-info">Inclusivity</h2>
          <p>Expats from all over the world have expressed that they feel like out standers when surrounded by Dutch people. When you don't speak the language, it can indeed feel lonely. We believe that no one should feel left out at any time. Community is important, especially if you are so far away from home. FindYourFolks is a safe space for everyone to share their own culture, without being afraid of judgement. </p>
          <h2 class="w-50 border-bottom border-3 border-info">Curiosity</h2>
          <p>FindYourFolks is looking for those with a raging curiosity. Those who want to know more about the world and the people around them. Curiosity is what makes us explore. And that's what we as FindYourFolks want to encourage – exploring. Get out of that bubble, step into the unknown. Who knows who or what you may run into? Rule number one of expectations: Don't have any. </p>
		  <h2 class="w-50 border-bottom border-3 border-info">Personal growth </h2>
          <p>Personal goalsetting and focusing on our development are important. Getting out of your comfort zone and meeting with people that are very different from you can be really frightening. You might be afraid of friction or judgement. Even though meeting new people can bring so many beautiful happenings! We as FindYourFolks want you to grow personally into a person you never thought you could be. It is okay to take it slow. One step at a time. Take the leap (or step), when you are ready, and when you want to, not when you feel like you have to. Growing should be a fun and nice experience. </p>
          <h2 class="w-50 border-bottom border-3 border-info">What we offer</h2>
          <p>FindYourFolks organises events for expats and Dutchies alike to completely emmerge themselves in the beauty that is culture. Dutchies will share their Dutch culture, while expats can share theirs. Enjoy a nice plate of hutspot with some papadum. Or put on your dancing shoes or clogs for a dance battle with the Brazilians.  </p>
		  <p>Come to the events for a day full of laughs, new faces, new experiences Feel the Folklore! </p>
